# Angular Invoice Creator

Welcome to my first Angular project! This is a simple and modern invoice creation app built using **Angular** and styled with **Bootstrap 5.3**. The app allows users to view, add, and remove invoice items directly from the UI. Currently, the data is hardcoded, but the structure is prepared for future integrations with a backend or API.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 Create and display invoices with itemized lists.
- ➕ Add new items with description, quantity, and price.
- 🗑️ Remove existing items from the invoice.
- 💰 Support for tax calculation (13% optional).
- 💵 Dynamic currency toggle: USD (`$`) or CRC (`₡`).
- 🧾 Export clean and styled PDFs using **jsPDF** and **autoTable**.
- 🎨 Responsive and modern design using **Bootstrap 5.3**.
